# Global Geopolitical Event Database
This is the repository for Global Geopolitical Events Database

## Overview

The Global Geopolitical Events Database compiles 833,485 major bilateral political events between all 193 UN member states from 1950 to 2024. Using large language models to systematically analyze and classify events, we construct dynamic measures of geopolitical alignment that capture the timing and intensity of international relationships. Each event is coded using the CAMEO framework and assigned Goldstein Scale scores (-10 to +10), enabling precise measurement of cooperation and conflict over seven decades.

## Access and Usage

Email me for a subsample—we have G8 + India + China ready to share.

The full database will be publicly available in phases:

- Geopolitical alignment measures for all country pairs (early next year)
- Complete bilateral event records with classifications and scores (later next year)
